I initially was going to look at the long pass data from the 2020/2021 WSL season to see which teams were the best at winning second balls after connecting the data to the video. But as I was working with the data, more patterns emerged.

The markdown contains the code that I used to extract all the long passes attempted. The excel file contains the passes that resulted in some sort of possession in the attacking third after the pass was made. The passes are color coded by which category they fall into.

The final analysis with the video can be seen on my substack: https://thetrivela.substack.com/p/why-chelsea-and-reading-were-successful
